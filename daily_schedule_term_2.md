## Daily Schedule Term 2

*Very generously, Taylor, Wheeler &amp; Bertschinger have made PDFs of the textbooks we will be using completely free. See links below.*

* [*Spacetime Physics, 2nd Edition*, https://www.eftaylor.com/spacetimephysics/](https://www.eftaylor.com/spacetimephysics/)
* [*Exploring Black Holes, 2nd Edition*, https://www.eftaylor.com/exploringblackholes/](https://www.eftaylor.com/exploringblackholes/)

### Week 1 &mdash; Galilean Relativity &mdash; Invariance of the Interval

* Thursday, Aug. 29 &mdash; We did a [calculus self-assessment](./exams/Exam0.nb.pdf) &mdash; We went over the [syllabus](./BlackHolesSyllabus.pdf) &mdash; You read pp. 1-15 of Chapter 1 of *Spacetime Physics, 2nd Edition* &mdash; Go to the excercises at the end of the Chapter and choose an exercise to work out and present (we chose to present 1-3 and 1-4) &mdash; Also read what Galileo's character [Salvatius has to say](./resources/GalileanRelativity-Salvatius.png) about Galilean relativity &mdash; I have written up and will talk you through [my own introduction](./resources/GalileanRelativity-Brian.pdf) to speed, velocity, and Galilean Relativity which is less elegant than Galileo's but uses the reliable crutch of Cartesian coordinate systems

### Week 2 &mdash; Free-Float Frames

* Monday, Sep. 2 &mdash; Read and be prepared to discuss *Spacetime Physics* to p. 30 (you can stop after examining Figure 2-5) &mdash; Note: everyone is getting a copy of *Spacetime Physics* that was ordered for them and distributed by CurCom (thank you!!), but if you haven't gotten yours, please come see me pronto and I can make you a copy of Chapter 2 which will get you through Week 2 &mdash; Problem Set 1 to be turned in at the beginning of Monday's class is [here](./assignments/ProblemSet01.nb.pdf) and in your file folders &mdash; I will at some point play [Chris Hadfield's cover of David Bowie's &ldquo;A Space Oddity&rdquo;](https://youtu.be/KaOC9danxNo) &mdash; At some point, I should prove [Galilean Addition of Velocities](./resources/GalileanAdditionOfVelocities.pdf) which establishes the near impossibility that the speed of light could possibly be constant &mdash; And yet it is(!), and it follows easily from the invariance of the interval &mdash; Finally, I want to spend a good fraction of class working out what is happening in Figure 2-5:
