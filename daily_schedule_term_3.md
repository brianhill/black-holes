### Week 8 &mdash; Relativistic Momentum and Energy

* Monday, Oct. 28 &mdash; No class (last day of Term 2-3 break)
* Thursday, Oct. 31 &mdash; Continue your study of Chapter 7 of *Spacetime Physics* to the end of Section 7.5, p. 206 &mdash; Problem Set 8, with due date delayed to the beginning of this Thursday's class, is [here](./assignments/ProblemSet08.nb.pdf)

### Week 9 &mdash; Start *Exploring Black Holes* &mdash; Spherical Polar Coordinates &mdash; Reduced Radius &mdash; Schwarzschild Metric

* Monday, Nov. 4 &mdash; Study Chapter 1 of *Exploring Black Holes* through Section 1-7, p. 1-13 &mdash; Problem Set 9 is [here](./assignments/ProblemSet09.nb.pdf) and in your file folders and two groups of you have volunteered for presentations as noted in the problem set &mdash; Discussion of the Principle of Extremal Aging &mdash; Spherical polar coordinates &mdash; The &ldquo;reduced&rdquo; radius
* Thursday, Nov. 7 &mdash; Study Chapter 2 of *Exploring Black Holes* through p. 2-20 &mdash; Problem Set 10 is [here](./assignments/ProblemSet10.nb.pdf) and in your file folders and a group (consisting of Eden and Sasha) will present the full Black Hole Company Construction Problem

### Week 10 &mdash; Finish Introducing the Schwarzschild Metric

* Monday, Nov. 11 &mdash; Problem Set 11 is [here](./assignments/ProblemSet11.nb.pdf) and in your file folders &mdash; Finish reading Chapter 2 &mdash; We discussed the relation between E, p, h, &lambda;, and &nu; for photons, and contrasted it with the relation between E, p, and m for massive particles* &mdash; Presentation: Walker and Rebecca, the Zeno's Paradox problem
* Thursday, Nov. 14 &mdash; Problem Set 12 is [here](./assignments/ProblemSet12.nb.pdf) and in your file folders &mdash; No new reading assignment (just continue to consolidate your understanding of Chapter 2) &mdash; Presentation: Eli and Eden, the Chesapeake Bay problem

### Week 11 &mdash; Exam 2 &mdash; Start Plunging

* Monday, Nov. 18 &mdash; [Exam 2](./exams/Exam2.nb.pdf) covering everything from Chapter 4 to Section 7.5 of *Spacetime Physics*, and Chapters 1 and 2 of *Exploring Black Holes*
* Thursday, Nov. 21 &mdash; Study Chapter 3 through Section 3-6 (through p. 3-18) &mdash; We need two groups of two presenters from among those that didn't present the last two times, so that would be Jeremy, Kel, Rania, and Sasha &mdash; The two topics I can imagine being good to present are Sample Problem 2 (p. 3-22) and Sample Problem 3 (p. 3-25) &mdash; Problem Set 13 is [here](./assignments/ProblemSet13.nb.pdf) and in your file folders

### Week 12 &mdash; Finish Plunging &mdash; Start Rain Coordinates
