## Daily Schedule Term 3

### Week 8 &mdash; Relativistic Momentum and Energy

* Monday, Oct. 28 &mdash; No class (last day of Term 2-3 break)
* Thursday, Oct. 31 &mdash; Continue your study of Chapter 7 of *Spacetime Physics* to the end of Section 7.5, p. 206 &mdash; Problem Set 8, with due date delayed to the beginning of this Thursday's class, is [here](./assignments/ProblemSet08.nb.pdf)

### Week 9 &mdash; Start *Exploring Black Holes*

NOTE: For the rest of Term 3, we will devote ourselves to covering at least half of *Exploring Black Holes,* [https://www.eftaylor.com/exploringblackholes/](https://www.eftaylor.com/exploringblackholes/) (the link is to the 2nd edition). Since all of you have physical copies of the 1st edition, page numbers below refer to it. To my mind, the 1st edition is actually the better edition, because the material in the 2nd edition that was added is too advanced for our purposes. One can always simply skip that material, but the simplicity and elegance of the text is obscured by its presence.

* Monday, Nov. 4 &mdash; Study Chapter 1 of *Exploring Black Holes* through Section 1-7, p. 1-13 &mdash; Problem Set 9 is [here](./assignments/ProblemSet09.nb.pdf) and in your file folders and two groups of you have volunteered for presentations as noted in the problem set
* Thursday, Nov. 7 &mdash; Study Chapter 2 of *Exploring Black Holes* through p. 2-20 &mdash; Problem Set 10 is [here](./assignments/ProblemSet10.nb.pdf) and in your file folders and a group (consisting of Eden and Sasha) will present the full Black Hole Company Construction Problem
